# Title of Dataset: A Feasibility Randomized Controlled Superiority Trial of Fluticasone-Vilanterol Once Daily Use for the Treatment of Mild Asthma in Adults

Give a brief summary of dataset contents, contextualized in experimental procedures and results.
Recruited patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio, to either treatment or control arm. The intervention arm received fluticasone furoate/vilanterol, Relvar )Ellipta( 100 μg /25 μg inhalation powder (30 doses) once daily use. The control arm received usual care which is albuterol (Ventolin, GlaxoSmithKline), 100 μg, two inhalations from a pressurized metered-dose inhaler as needed for symptom relief with or without Fluticasone propionate (Flixotide Evohaler) 125 μg two inhalations from a pressurized metered-dose inhaler. We investigated patients’ experience of asthma, including their quality of life, asthma control, and the incidence of exacerbations.
The Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ-S) consists of 32 questions that assess the quality of life of asthma patients, scored on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (all of the time) to 7 (none of the time). Higher scores indicate better quality of life.

The Asthma Control Questionnaire (6 items) (ACQ-6): consists of 6 questions that assess asthma symptoms in the previous week, scored on a 7-point scale that ranges from 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (very severe symptoms) in which a 0.5-unit change represents the minimal clinically important difference. Higher scores indicate worse asthma control.

## Description of the data and file structure

The data consists of the following variables:
•	Row1: Arm (categorical variable) which refers to control or treatment patient, with the value of 1= control arm, 2= treatment arm.
•	Row 2: Sex is a categorical variable with the value of 0=Male and 1=Female
•	Row 3: Age is a continuous variable (scale). 
•	Row 4 to 9: The Asthma Control Questionnaire (6 items) (ACQ-6) (categorical variable): consists of 6 questions that assess asthma symptoms in the previous week, scored on a 7-point scale that ranges from 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (very severe symptoms) in which a 0.5-unit change represents the minimal clinically important difference. Higher scores indicate worse asthma control.
•	Rows 10 and 11 is the sum score of all items in the asthma control questionnaire pre and post intervention respectively. 
•	Row 12 to 43 is the Questions for the Asthma quality of life (categorical variable) which consists of 32 questions that assess the quality of life of asthma patients, scored on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (all of the time) to 7 (none of the time).0=Null for no answer.  Higher scores indicate better quality of life. 
•	Row 44 is the total score for QoL questions (continuous variable, scale measure). 
•	Row 45 represents the post intervention mean QoL score and row 46 is the pre intervention mean QoL score. Both are continuous, scale variables. 
•	Rows 47 to 54 are the sum of questions from QoL questionnaire relating to 4 domains pre and post intervention: activity limitations, symptoms, emotional functioning, environmental stimuli. These are continuous, scale variables. 
•	Rows 55 to 59 are questions exploring exacerbation of asthma. These are categorical variables with 0= Yes, 1=No, 3=Null (for no answer). 
•	For the missing values in patients 17 and 18, we used Null to indicate no response.
