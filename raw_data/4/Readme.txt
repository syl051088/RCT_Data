METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION

1. Description of methods used for collection/generation of data: supplementary files and study protocol from publication in PeerJ

2. Methods for processing the data: all data were generated from collected data
This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand from February 2018 to August 2018. All patients with CHC who achieved SVR within 1 year after DAA therapy in the hepatology clinic were assessed for eligibility. Baseline clinical characteristics, HCV genotypes, liver enzymes, and FIB-4 and APRI scores were assessed. Blood samples were collected at baseline and at the end of the 6-week follow-up and were kept at −70°C until analysis. All blood samples were simultaneously analysed for TGF-ß1, TIMP-1, MMP-9, and P3NPlevels at the end of the study. Pill counts and patient interviews were used to assess adherence to the prescribed medications. All participants were asked to refrain from outside-of-trial vitamin D or multivitamin supplements and to maintain their normal activity. At the end of the study, patients who remained in a VD insufficient state received VD supplementation as a standard of care.
