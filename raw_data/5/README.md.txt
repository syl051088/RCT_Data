Automated, medication-targeted alerts for Acute Kidney Injury â€“ A randomized trial
---

This is a dataset that reflects the data collected as part of a clinical trial known as the "ELAIA-2" trial, which evaluated the effectiveness of automated acute kidney injury alerts for hospitalized individuals exposed to one of three classes of medicaitions of interest.


## Description of the data and file structure

Each row of data represents a single patient enrolled in the ELAIA-2 trial.
