## Description of the data and file structure

This dataset was collected as part of a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of **Snoezelen intervention** on **problem behaviors** in children with cerebral palsy (CP). The trial involved 28 participants aged 2 to 5 years, divided into an experimental group receiving the Snoezelen intervention and a control group receiving standard care. Data was collected over a 4-week period, with the experimental group receiving Snoezelen sessions three times a week. **Problem behaviors** and emotional changes were assessed using the **Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL)** and the **Korean Parenting Stress Index (K-PSI)** before and after the intervention.

### Missing Values:

* Missing values are indicated with **"NA"** in all data files.

## Code/software

**Software**: The data was analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics. This software was used to perform various statistical tests, including descriptive statistics, Spearman's rank correlation, and non-parametric tests such as the Mann-Whitney U test and Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test.

**Code/Scripts**: No custom code or scripts were used, as the analysis was conducted using built-in functionalities of IBM SPSS.

**Workflow**: The dataset, provided in CSV format, was imported into IBM SPSS for analysis. Descriptive statistics were first calculated to summarize demographic information and behavior changes. The Spearman's correlation test was used to assess relationships between GMFCS levels and emotional reactivity changes, and non-parametric tests were performed to compare the experimental and control groups' pre- and post-intervention results.

## Access information

No external datasets were used in this study. All data were collected as part of the current research project.
